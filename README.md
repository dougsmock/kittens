# kittens
My son and I spend 3 hours a week volunteering at the animal shelter, tending to kittens. This is a program in Ruby-based Sonic Pi to describe a typical shift in the kitten nursery.

Following are routine chores, roughly in this order:

Clock in
Make gruel (wet food for smallest kittens)
Check/refill water
Check/refill food
Check/clean kitty litter
Weigh kittens in all 10 cages
Play with a kitten or two
Clock out

There will be several functions, with 3 containing an “if” statement, and we handle the “weigh kittens” step on a “10 times.do” loop.
